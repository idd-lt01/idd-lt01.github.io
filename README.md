# George Brown College
## Interaction Design and Development Website Redesign
My inspiration for this re-design was to highlight the beautiful new building located on Lower Jarvis. 
I wanted to highlight that the program is specialized and multidisciplinary.
Another main design component of my redesign was to explore Interaction, Design, and Development individually. 
In my first year at George brown, and to this day, we discuss what it means to be an Interaction Designer; 
And I think that exploring each word and its meaning can provide someone an understanding of what it means.

I chose colours directly from the George Brown website. 
I focused on using Purple because it is the designated colour for the School of Design provided on the Main GBC website.
